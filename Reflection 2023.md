# Reflection

## Day 01
150/611; points: 0, --th place
* `digits` was amazing, sucks I misread the question
* Had some issues with overloads, will have to look into that.
* Had issues with recording because I still had "0" bound as start stop recording.

## Day 02
265/125; points: 0, --th place
* My project was a bit too cursed, so I tried fixing it 15 minutes before the contest.
  * This was dumb; I broke it fully and had to use Python instead

## Day 03
84/125; points: 17, 275th place
* First points
* My code was slow, cause I used a list instead of a set (I wanted to use a set, but messed up)
* [x] make code use `asSet` where applicable, and make that method warn 
      if a collection is passed multiple times, but isn't a set
* Apparently the slowdown has from the fact that SimpleGrid had a hashcode and equals

## Day 04
201/103; points: 0, 324th place
* I really should run my code on the test input first
* I accidentally use python syntax instead of kotlin syntax

## Day 05
41/2; points: 159, 
* LET's FUCKING GO
* [ ] Fix overload issue between stdlib and utils (min/max)


## Day 11
5/47; points: 150
* Nice points: TOP 50
* Didn't use GitHub copilot today,
* [ ] Convert a list of BoundedGridPoints to Points easily

## Day 12

* Nice
* People used more bruteforce for day one to go faster but that cost
    them for part 2
* Could have used yComb
* [x] Add memoize functions
* [x] Allow yComb to be memoized easily

# Day 13
53/81
* A bit slow I think? 
  * Didn't sleep that well
  * I didn't do my finger stretched today, idk if that's related
* I don't think using a grid here helped me
