* `digits` was amazing, sucks I misread the question
* Had some issues with overloads, will have to look into that.
* Had issues with recording because I still had "0" bound as start stop recording.

## Day 02

* My project was a bit too cursed, so I tried fixing it 15 minutes before the contest.
  * This was dumb; I broke it fully and had to use Python instead

## Day 03

* First points
* My code was slow, cause I used a list instead of a set (I wanted to use a set, but messed up)
* [ ] make code use `asSet` where applicable, and make that method warn 
      if a collection is passed multiple times, but isn't a set
