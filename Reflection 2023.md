* `digits` was amazing, sucks I misread the question
* Had some issues with overloads, will have to look into that.
* Had issues with recording because I still had "0" bound as start stop recording.

## Day 02
265/125; points: 0, --th place
* My project was a bit too cursed, so I tried fixing it 15 minutes before the contest.
  * This was dumb; I broke it fully and had to use Python instead

## Day 03
84/125; points: 17, 275th place
* First points
* My code was slow, cause I used a list instead of a set (I wanted to use a set, but messed up)
* [x] make code use `asSet` where applicable, and make that method warn 
      if a collection is passed multiple times, but isn't a set
* Apparently the slowdown has from the fact that SimpleGrid had a hashcode and equals

## Day 04
201/103; points: 0, 324th place
* I really should run my code on the test input first
* I accidentally use python syntax instead of kotlin syntax

## Day 05
